# This is a sample GitLab CI/CD configuration file that should run without any modifications.
# It demonstrates a basic 3 stage CI/CD pipeline. Instead of real tests or scripts,
# it uses echo commands to simulate the pipeline execution.
#
# A pipeline is composed of independent jobs that run scripts, grouped into stages.
# Stages run in sequential order, but jobs within stages run in parallel.
#
# For more information, see: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#stages

stages:          # List of stages for jobs, and their order of execution
  - test


unit-test-job:   # This job runs in the test stage.
  stage: test    # It only starts when the job in the build stage completes successfully.
  script:
    - if [ ! -d node_modules ]; then cnpm i; fi
    - export DISPLAY=':99.0'
    - Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1024x768x24 > /dev/null 2>&1 &
    - npm run test && echo test FAIL
    - kill -9 `ps -ef | grep Xvfb| grep -v grep|awk '{print $2}'`
